PyWN("pin") - Python WordNet

WordNet is available from www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn

Download and install the latest wordnet distrobution.(Actually, all that
is required is an up-to-date format for the data files. PyWN is pure
Python and makes no use of the C libraries provided with wordnet.

Put each of the .py files somewhere in your python search path.

>>> from stdwn import impl
>>> synsets = impl.lookupSynsetsByForm("run")
