# lexiconator

## Introduction

Lexiconator is a very simple learning aid to help improve your vocabulary, much like flash cards, primarily intended for use by candidates preparing for various tests that emphasize a large vocabulary, like the GRE. It lets you rate words as you encounter them. Using these ratings, you can filter for words based on a rating range, thus letting you revise only those words that you found intimidating. (This app was inspired by the ordeals that I saw my younger brother experience as I was helping him prepare for the vocabulary section of the GRE.)

## Requirements

Written in Python, it has a console based GUI (based on curses) and hence will run "as is" on most Posix systems with Python (version >= 2.6) installed. Will work on Windows with Cygwin (not tested). As such, its only requirements are the aforementioned Python interpreter.

## Installation Procedure

There isn't any. To run the client, just navigate to the **lexiconator-client/src** directory in your terminal and run:

`
python __main.py__
`
